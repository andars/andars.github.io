# Quotes from *Mindstorms*

> Slowly I began to formulate what I still consider the fundamental fact about learning: Anything is easy if you can assimilate it to
> your collection of models. If you can't, anything can be painfully difficult.


> It is this double relationship -- both abstract and sensory -- that gives the gear the power ot carry powerful mathematics into
> the mind ... *I fell in love with the gears* ... Something very personal happened, and one cannot assume that it would be repeated
> for other children in exactly the same form ... What the gears cannot do the computer might. The computer is the Proteus of machines.
> Its essence is it universality, its power to simulate ... This book is the result of my own attempts over the past decade to turn
> computers into instruments flexible enough so that many children can each create for themselves something like what the gears were
> for me.


> Difficulty with school math is often the first step of an invasive intellectual process that leads us all to define ourselves
> as bundles of aptitudes and ineptitudes, as being "mathematical" or "not mathematical," "artistic" or "not artistic," "musical"
> or "not musical," "profound" or "superficial," "intelligent" or "dumb."


> Learning to be a master programmer is learning to become highly skilled at isolating and correcting "bugs", the parts that keep the
> program from working. The question to ask about the program is not whether it is right or wrong, but if it is fixable. If this way
> of looking at intellectual products were genearlized to how the larger culture thinks about knowledge and its acquisition, we all
> might be less intimidated by our fears of "being wrong".

- **QWERTY Phenomenon**: "There is a tendency for the first usable, but still primitive, product of a new technology to dig itself in."

> In our culture, fear of learning is no less endemic (although more frequently disguised) than fear of mathematics. Children
> begin their lives as eager and competent learners. They have to *learn* to have trouble with learning in general and mathematics
> in particular. In both senses of "math" [mathematics & learning] there is a shift from mathophile to mathophobe, from lover of mathematics
> and of learning to a person fearful of both.

### Principles of Appropriable mathematics
1. Continuity Principle:

    > The mathematics must be continuous with well-established personal knowledge from which it can inherit a sense of warmth and
    > value as well as "cognitive" competence.
2. Power Principle:

    > It must empower the learner to perform personally meaningful projects that could not be done without it.
3. Principle of Cultural Resonance

    > The topic must make sense in terms of a larger social context ... it will not truly make sense to children unless it is accepted
    > by adults too.

> First, relate what is new and to be learned to something you already know. Second, take what is new and make it your own:
> Make something new with it, play with it, build with it.


> Unorthodox theories of young children are not deficiencies or cognitive gaps, they serve as ways of flexing cognitive muscles, of
> developing and working through the necessary skills needed for more orthodox theorizing.


> The cultural assimilation of the computer presence will give rise to a computer literacy. This phrase is often taken as meaning
> knowing how to program, or knowing about the varied uses made of computers. But true computer literacy is not just knowing how
> to make use of comuters and computational ideas. It is knowing when it is appropriate to do so.


> The important question is not whether the brain or the computer is discrete but whether knowledge is modularizable.


> In earlier chapters it was suggested that how we think about knowledge affects how we think about ourselves. In particular,
> our image of knowledge as divided up into different kinds leads us to a view of people as divided up according to what their
> aptitudes are. This in turn leads to a balkanization of our culture.


> It was not made. It happened. This must be true too of any new successful forms of associations for learning that might emerge out
> of the mathetic computer culture. Powerful new social forms must have their roots in the culture, not be the creatures of bureaucrats.
