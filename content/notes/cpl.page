# Quotes from *The Character of Physical Law*

> The next question was - what makes planets go around the sun? At the time of Kepler some people answered this problem
> by saying that there were angels behind them beating their wings and pushing the planets around an orbit. As you will see,
> the answer is not very far from the truth. The only difference is that the angels sit in a different direction and push
> their wings inwards. (page 18)


> Today our theories of phyics, the laws of physics, are a multitude of different parts and pieces that do not fit together
> very well. We do not have one structure from which all is deduced; we have several pieces that do not quite fit exactly yet.
> ... But what is very strange is that there are certain things which are the same in both [gravity and electricity].
> (page 30)


> But the most impressive fact is that gravity is simple. It is simple to state the principles completely and not have left
> any vagueness for anybody to change the ideas of the law. It is simple, and therefore it is beautiful. I do not mean it is
> simple in its action - the motions of the various planets and the perturbations of one on the other can be quite complicated
> to work out ... but the basic pattern or the system beneath the whole thing is simple. This is common to all our laws; they
> all turn out to be simple things, although complex in their actual actions. (page 33-34)


> What does the planet do? Does it look at the sun, see how far away it is, and decide to calculuate on its internal
> adding machine the inverse of the distance, which tells it how much to move? This is certainly no explanation of the
> machinery of gravitation! ... [Newton] said, 'It tells you *how* it moves. That should be enough. I have told you how it
> moves, not why.' (page 37)


> Every one of our laws is a purely mathematical statement in rather complex and abstruse mathematics ... It gets more and
> more difficult as we go on. Why? I have not the slightest idea. (page 39)


> Mathematics is just organized reasoning (page 41)


> Now we have a problem. We can deduce from one part of physics, like the Law of Gravititation, a principle which turns
> out to be more valid that the derivation ... Newton had other postulates by which he could get the more general
> conservation law of angular momentum. But these Newtonian laws were wrong. There are no forces, it is all a lot of boloney,
> the particles do not have orbits, and so on. Yet the analogue, the exact transformation of this principle about the areas
> and the conservation of angular momentum, is true. It works for atomic motions in quantum mechanics, and, as far as we
> can tell, it is still exact today. (page 49)


> Physics is not mathematics, and mathematics is not physics. One helps the other. But in physics you have an understanding
> of the connection of words with the real world. (page 55)


> I really think that those two cultures [[those of C.P. Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures)] separate
> people who have and people who have not had this experience of understanding mathematics well enough to appreciate nature
> once. It is too bad that it has to be mathematics, and that mathematics is hard for some people ... If you want to learn
> about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in. (page 58)


> In order to avoid simply describing experiments that have been done, we have to propose laws beyond their observed range.
> There is nothing wrong with that, despite the fact that it makes science uncertain. If you thought before that science was
> certain - well, that is just an error on your part. (page 77)


> How do we know that [the laws of physics] belong together? How do we know that they are really part of one as yet incomplete
> picture? We are not sure, and it worries us to some extenet, but we get encouragement from the common characteristics of
> several pieces. They all show blue sky, or the are all made out of the same kind of wood. All the various physical laws
> obey the same conservation principles. (page 83)


> Professor [Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl), the mathematician, gave an excellent definition of symmetry,
> which is that a thing is symmetrical if there is something that you can do to it so that after you have finished doing it
> it look the same as it did before. (page 84)


> As time went on, new laws were discovered after Newton,
> among them the [laws of electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations) discovered by Maxwell.
> One of the consequences of the laws of electricity was that there should be waves, electromagnetic waves - light is an
> example - which should go at 186,000 miles a second, *flat* ... So it was easy to tell where rest was, because the law that
> light goes at 186,000 miles a second is certainly not (at first sight) one which will permit one to move without some
> effect. (page 91)


> A generalization of the two-dimensional rotation that I spoke about was therefore made into space and time, so that time
> was added to space to make a four-dimensional world. It is not merely and artificial addition ... Real space has, in a
> sense, the characteristic that its existence is independent of the particular point of view, and that looked at from
> different points of view a certain amount of 'forward-backward' can get mixed up with 'left-right'. In an analogous way
> a certain amount of time 'future-past' can get mixed up with a certain amount of space. Space and time must be completely
> interlocked (page 93-94)


> The thing that is interesting is that if you measure the spin - electrons are spinning as they come out - you find that they
> are spinning to the left ... It is as though in the beta decay the gun that was shooting out the electron were a rifled
> gun ... Therefore it is possible to tell right from left, and thus the law that the world is symmetrical for left and right
> has collapsed. (page 103)


> Things are irreversible only in a sense that going one way is likely, but going the other way, although it is possible and
> is according to the laws of physics, would not happen in a million years. (page 112)


> To stand at either end, and to walk off that end of the pier only, hoping that out in that direction is the complete
> understanding, is a mistake. And to stand with evil and beauty and hope, or to stand with the fundamental laws, hoping that
> way to get a deep understanding of the whole world, with that aspect alone, is a mistake ... The great mass of workers in
> between, connecting one step to another, are improving all the time our understanding of the world, both from working at the
> ends and working in the middle, and in that way we are gradually understanding this tremendous world of interconnecting
> hierarchies. (page 126-127)


> There was a time when the newspapers said that only twelve men understood the theory of relativity. I do not believe there
> ever was such a time ... On the other hand, I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics ... Do not
> keep saying to yourself, if you can possibly avoid it, 'But how can it be like that?' ... Nobody knows how it can be like
> that. (page 129)


> Of course we are not averse to using the theory of probability, that is calculating odds, when a situation is very
> complicated ... But here what we are proposing, is it not, is that there is probability all the way back: that in the
> fundamental laws of physics there are odds. (page 145)


> In general we look for a new law by the following process. First we guess it. Then we compute the consequences of the guess
> to see what would be implied if this law that we guessed is right. Then we compare the result of the computation to nature, > with experiment or experience, compare it directly with observation, to see if it works. If it disagress with experiment it
> is wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science. It does not make any difference how beautiful your guess is. It
> does not make any difference how smart you are, who made the guess, or what his name is - if it disagrees with experiment
> it is wrong. (page 156)


> Suppose you invent a good guess, calculate the consequences, and discover every time that the consequences you have
> calculated agree with experiment. The theory is then right? No, it is simply not proved wrong ... We never are definitely
> right, we can only be sure we are wrong. (page 158)


> We must, and we should, and we always do, extend as far as we can beyond what we already know, beyond those ideas that we
> have already obtained. Dangerous? Yes. Uncertain? Yes. But it is the only way to make progress. Although it is uncertain,
> it is necessary to make science useful. Science is only useful if it tells you about some experiment that has not been done;
> it is no good if it only tells you what just went on. (page 164)


> It is not unscientific to make a guess, although many people who are not in science think it is. (page 165)


> Then there is another school of thought, which has only one representative, myself, which says no, the thing may be
> complicated and become simple only through the complications. The Greeks believed that the orbits of the planets were
> circles. Actually they are ellipses. They are not quite symmetrical, but they are very close to circles. Why are they nearly
> symmetrical? Because of a long complicated effect of tidal friction - a very complicated idea. (page 167)


> It seems to me that what can happen in the future is either that all the laws become known ... or it may happen that the
> experiments get harder and harder to make, more and more expensive, so you get 99.9 percent of the phenomena, but there is
> always some phenomenon which has just been discovered, which is very hard to measure, and which disagrees; and as soon as
> you have the explanation of that one there is always another one, and it gets slower and slower and more and more
> uninteresting. That is another way it may end. (page 172)


> What is it about nature that lets this happen, that it is possible to guess from one part what the rest is going to do?
> That is an unscientific question: I do not know how to answer it, and therefore I am going to give an unscientific answer.
> I think it is because nature has a simplicity and therefore a great beauty. (page 173)
